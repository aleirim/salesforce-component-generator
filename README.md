### Salesforce: components generation after import

What if in the scope of testing a Salesforce application we need to generate multiple components like js buttons, list views, objects, lightning components, etc.? Doing this manually can be quite cumbersome and time consuming. This example illustrate a workaround to handle such scenario using MetadataAPI, spcifically the [Metadata API Apex Wrapper] (https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi)
